    <h1>An Interactive Analysis of Neonatal
        Health Data in the United States</h1>
    <h2>CIS4301 Project Group 03</h2> <br>
    <h3> This tool supports researchers interested in analyzing trends in
        natality data from the United States of America by county between the years 2000 and 2005.
        This is a prototype. The current implementation relies solely on public data,
        which is available with geolocation by county information for 2007 and earlier. Because of storage space
        restrictions, this prototype uses data from the years ..... and from the states..... <br>
